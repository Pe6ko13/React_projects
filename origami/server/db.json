I've also seen people use this design as a bread-bowl in a restaurant! It looked fantastic, such a nice novelty, but you would need an enormous piece of paper for that one!

The smaller and thinner the paper you use, the more difficult it is to the petals at the end. One thing that works very well is using this design for napkins or paper serviettes.",
